 * @title LORD Token Contract

 *
 * The contract includes the following key features:
 * - Marketing tax: Defines buy and sell marketing taxes for transactions involving Uniswap.
 * - Wallet limits: Implements a maximum wallet limit to prevent a single address from holding too much of the total supply.
 * - Tax exclusions: Allows the exclusion of specific addresses from paying marketing taxes or being subject to the wallet limit.
 * - Uniswap integration: Facilitates token swaps on Uniswap, with a router and pair addresses set up for liquidity management.
